# Augmented-Reality-for-Introducing-Tongkonan-Toraja-Traditional-House
  One of my best projects is the AR Tongkonan Toraja application, which uses advanced augmented reality to introduce and educate users about the culturally significant Tongkonan Toraja traditional house from the Toraja tribe in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. This project excels by seamlessly integrating detailed 3D models, interactive features, and rich educational content, creating an engaging and immersive experience. Users can explore and interact with the virtual Tongkonan Toraja house, gaining a deeper understanding and appreciation of its unique architecture and cultural heritage, and the application has received exceptionally positive user feedback, placing it in the top 10% of similar applications for user experience.
